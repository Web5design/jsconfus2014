  <h1>Significant Others Track</h1>

  <div class='well'><b>Note:</b> Details coming soon!</div>

  <p>The Significant Others Track has been a part of the JSConf US tradition since the very first event in 2009. This year we are doing things a little bit differently, so please make sure to read the following and check back regularly as we are still evolving this year's plan.</p>

  <p>As an attending Significant Other, you will be able to make use of the available bikes free of charge. You are also welcome to join in the poolside and beachside activities and the evening campfires.</p>

  <p>For the following items, you will need a regsitered ticket in order to participate. While the vast majority of the cost of these events is covered for you by a yet to be determined sponsor, we will be requiring a small ticket price for each of the events you will be participating in.</p>

   <p>If you are bringing children and need a little time away from them the Omni provides a wonderful child care program that is full of excitement and activity. Children between the ages of 4 - 12 can attend day time and/or evening events at Camp Amelia, <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/AmeliaIsland/ResortActivities/kidsandfamily.aspx">details are here</a>. If you are planning on utilizing the Camp Amelia, please ensure you register with the Omni at least 24-hour in advance.  Call (904) 432-1451 for more information.</p>

   <p>Also if you are in need of a baby sitter for a period of time while at JSConf, please review: <a href="http://sunshinebabysitting.com/">http://sunshinebabysitting.com/</a>.</p>
