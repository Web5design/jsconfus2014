</div>
<p>At JSConf, we strive every year to push the boundaries of what is possible with JS by spotlighting the future of the language and those making that future a reality. If you haven't spoken at a JSConf, you are actually in a better position than those that have because we want new people, new ideas, and new presentations. We have a long history of focusing on individuals that would otherwise never get a stage. We have made JSConf the platform for risky, crazy, and amazing things to flourish into even bigger, more widely-known products, ideas, and libraries. Many of the brightest things in JS have their roots deeply engrained with JSConf and this is something we take incredible pride in. We push ourselves each year to take riskier and riskier speakers, because they define the discussion about JS over the next year or years. Unlike other events, attendees do not come to JSConf to learn JS, they come to have their minds blown about what they had never thought could be possible with JS. </p>

<p>We have <a href="">opened up a more traditional Call for Speakers form</a> and that will remain open until Friday, November 30th at 12:00PM EST. As we have always done, we are seeking out new ideas and concepts that push the boundaries of JS and the JS community. We welcome strange and unusual presentations as long as they remain within the boundaries of our well established <a href="http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. We are looking for talks focused on all parts of JS, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data Management</li>
<li>Web Security</li>
<li>MVC Frameworks</li>
<li>Server Side JS</li>
<li>Compile to JS Languages/JSVM</li>
<li>Mobile Web</li>
<li>Future of JS</li>
<li>Education and Outreach of Computer Programming</li>
</ul>


<p>We are champions of a different approach to finding speaker as well with a process called an "inverse call for speakers". Unlike a traditional call for spekaers, if you want to nominate a person and idea that you would like to see, you can submit that as well into our <a href="">call for speakers</a>. If you are the person submitting yourself, which is completely cool and encouraged, please mark your submission as "this is me", so we can write you back if your submission is or is not accepted.</p>

<h2>Training Included</h2>

<p>We understand that people attend JSConf for a wide variety of reasons, whether it is to build deep relationships, be part of the next generation of JS, or to learn JS and all it has to offer. Historically, we have, admittedly, not focused on that last item and this has caused confusion and frustration with some attendees that arrive with a different expectation. This is probably the single biggest modification we did in 2013 and it was a huge success. Training will be provided as an isolated, parallel track. Trainings will be provided for free in 1 or 2 hour blocks (allocation based on topic complexity) that align against the main track's schedule. We will try to schedule this track as carefully as possible to avoid the "I want to be in two tracks at the same time" problem, but unfortunately that might happen. We are seeking individuals and/or organizations with a proven track record of providing best-of-breed training to conduct these segments. If you are ready to help educate JS developers at JSConf, please email us at <a href="training@jsconf.us">training@jsconf.us</a>.</p>
