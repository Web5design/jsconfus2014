  <h4>Bikes, Bikes, and More Bikes</h4>
  <p>A fleet of bikes will be available allowing you to trek around the property on approximately seven miles of bicycle trails that will take you to some of Amelia Island Plantation's points of interest such as Aury Island, Drummond Point Park and Walker's Landing. Plantation trail maps and bikes will be available at Amelia's Wheels, just pick one up when you need/want one and return it once you are done!</p>

  <h3>Tuesday May 27th, 2014</h3>
  <h4>Shuttles from Jacksonville International Airport to Amelia Island</h4>
  <p>Unless arriving by private jet or space craft, Amelia Island is quite remote and that is a very good thing for our purposes. Unfortunately it does make getting here a little complex, but to make it a little easier we will be providing shuttles from the airport on a schedule interval. Details will be out shortly as well as the times the shuttle will run after we have a rough manifest of when everyone is arriving.</p>

  <h4>The Docking Station Welcome Reception  6:00PM - 9:00PM</h4>
  <p>After a long day of travel, land at the beach for an evening welcome reception and social gathering. Meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy the sand between your toes! We will have various things going on during this event including light appetizers and refreshments. We may have various rockets takeoffs throughout the evening, so your space helmet is completely optional.</p>



  <h3>Wednesday May 28th, 2014</h3>
  <h4>Significant Others Track - 10:30AM - 5:00PM</h4>

This track does require registration with a nominal fee and can, if so desired include breakfast with the conference for a fee.
